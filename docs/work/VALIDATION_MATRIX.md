# Validation Matrix

## Field Ownership

- Human owns proof overrides and acceptance sign-off.
- AI recommends proof types, links evidence, and updates status from verification.

This file maps accepted behavior and work items to proof.

Policy lives in `docs/standards/VALIDATION.md`. This matrix is runtime project state and should change as work is planned, implemented, changed, or retired.

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| planned | Accepted as intended behavior, not implemented |
| in_progress | Actively being built or verified |
| implemented | Implemented and evidence exists |
| changed | Contract or expected proof changed after earlier implementation |
| retired | No longer part of the accepted project contract |

## Matrix

| Requirement | Phase | Ticket/Bug | Contract/Behavior | Unit | Integration | E2E | UAT | Platform/Manual | Docs Review | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TBD | TBD | TBD | Add rows when requirements, tickets, or bugs are created | no | no | no | no | no | no | planned | none |

## Rules

- Add or update a row when a requirement, ticket, bug, public contract, or accepted behavior is created or changed.
- Mark proof columns `yes`, `no`, or `not_required`.
- Link evidence to `docs/templates/TEST_VERIFICATION.md`, ticket verification sections, UAT, docs review, release notes, or command output summaries.
- Do not set `implemented` until required proof has evidence.
- If a proof type is `not_required`, record the reason in the linked ticket, bug, or verification artifact.
