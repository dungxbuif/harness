*(No unreleased changes)*

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Feedback Intake Flow**: Added `PHASE 0: FEEDBACK INTAKE & TRIAGE` to the Agent Lifecycle.
- **Feedback Funnel**: Created `docs/work/FEEDBACK_LOG.md` to serve as the raw intake funnel for all user feedback before entering the backlog.
- **Feedback Template**: Created `docs/templates/FEEDBACK.md` for deep-dive analysis of complex user feedback.
- **SDD Template**: Added `docs/templates/SDD.md` (Software Design Document) to track high-level system architecture and required its synchronization upon detail design changes in `DOCS.md`.

### Changed
- **Triage Types**: Allowed triage types for user feedback in `WORKFLOW.md` now explicitly include `Enhancement`.
- **Detail Design Revamp**: Revamped `docs/templates/DETAIL_DESIGN.md` structure. It now integrates visual components (Architecture Overview, Execution Flow, API & Data Model Design, Security) while retaining strict Harness lifecycle metadata and reconciliation rules.
- **Agent Rules**: Updated `AGENTS.md` (Rule 9: Completion Rules) to strictly enforce writing framework and user-facing changes to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Docs Guide**: Updated `docs/README.md` to include the new templates and feedback intake funnel.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Initial SDLC agent framework scaffold.
